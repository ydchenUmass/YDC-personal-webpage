Welcome to visit my website. I am a lecturer in [Data Analytics and Computational Social Science Program(DACSS)](https://www.umass.edu/social-sciences/academics/dacss) at the University of Massachusetts Amherst. Trained as a political scientist, my research interests include court and judicial politics, comparative public opinion, and political participation with a specific focus in China and the US. You can find more information in my [CV](files/CV_Yu.pdf) and [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=9ODvxwQAAAAJ&hl=en&oi=ao)) for my recent research and teaching.

Before joining DACSS, I taught in the Department of Political Science at Grinnell College. I also served as a research intern at the Institute for Policy Studies in Washington, D.C., and The Carter Center in Atlanta. Additionally, I worked as an assistant in a law clinic at Sun Yat-sen University.
